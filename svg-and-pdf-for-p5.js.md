Revision: 1 (Draft)

## Part 1 - SVG Support for p5.js

### Frist of all, why SVG?

- Resolution Independence

- Tool chains!

    SVG works with Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.
    It would be wonderful if designers can easily exports their p5.js to svg,
    and continue their work on SVG.
    Also, it would be great if p5.js could import SVG,
    because many resources files are in SVG.

- Accessibility

    Different from canvas, SVGs are accessible.
    That is, the text can be selected and can be easily copy and could be used for TTS.

- Object Based Events

    Want to bind click on a custom shape? Use SVG!
    SVG's API are born to be object based!

- Filters!

    Now that SVGs are object based,
    we can apply filters on object. (use blur, for example)

### Example Usage

#### In Canvas

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(width, height);
}
```

```javascript
var myshape;
function preload() {
    myshape = loadImage('myshape.svg');
}
```

```javascript
var x = 0,
    y = 0;
function draw() {
    background(0);
    shapeMode(CORNERS);
    shape(myshape, x, y, w, h); // draw svg on current canvas
    x++;
    y++;
}
```

#### In SVG

After a long consideration,
I think that maybe a custom API for SVG is better.
It won't confuse our users and the `new Object` really means create object.
An object is like a mover in `The Nature of Code`.

```javascript
var svg;
function setup() {
    svg = createSVG(width, height); // enter SVG mode
}
```

```javascript
var myshape;
function preload() {
    myshape = loadImage('myshape.svg');
}
```

```javascript
var s,
    x = 0,
    y = 0;
function draw() {
    if (!s) {
        // insert svg on current svg
        shapeMode(CORNERS);
        // note that when in canvas mode this will throw an exception
        s = new Shape(myshape, x, y, w, h);
        // s.shapeMode now is CORNERS
    } else {
        // Note that s.x is defined via Object.defineProperty with setter overridden
        // So, when s.x updated, the position of s will follow the change
        // See also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty
        // If this API is aggressive, then maybe something like `s.set('x', x)` or `s.x = x; s.update()` ?
        s.x = x;
        s.y = y;
    }
    x++;
    y++;
}
```

### API Outline

#### OOP API

- shapeMode

- shape(Shape, x, y, w, h)

    Loading shape to canvas

- new Shape(svg)

    For loading existing svg to svg

- new Shape(img)

    For loading existing jpg/png to svg

- Basic shapes in p5.js

```javascript
function setup () {
    ellipse = new Ellipse(x, y, w, h);
}
```

```javascript
function draw () {
    ellipse.width++;
    ellipse.update();
}
```

- shape.x

- shape.y

- shape.filter

    Set filter for this object. Should allow SVG filters and provide some simply filters.

    See also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter

    ```javascript
    var r = 0,
        ellipse;
    function setup () {
        ellipse = new Ellipse(x, y, w, h);
    }
    function draw () {
        var myfilter = new SVG.Filter.Blur('5px');
        ellipse.filter = myfilter;
    }
    ```

#### Manipulate SVG (low-level API)

Like p5.dom's API, but more for SVG.

- SVG.createElement

- SVG.createGroup

    for svg's \<g\>

- SVG.createRect and other basic shapes

    See also: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/shapes.html

- SVG.SVGElement.prototype.attr

- SVG.SVGElement.prototype.style

- Some other methods p5.Element provides

#### Export

- toDataURL

```javascript
var svg;
function setup() {
    svg = createSVG(width, height);
}
```

```javascript
function draw() {
    if (some condition) {
        // draw something
    } else {
        noLoop();
        var dataURL = svg.toDataURL();
    }
}
```

### FAQ

#### Why not PShape?

I think that PShape is somehow not that natural for SVG.
SVG is something more DOM like.
So, the manipulation of svg is dom like api.

Also, I think in SVG's world, we should treat shapes as object.
Thus, an OOP api was designed.

#### Performance Issue

I have tested the performance of svg using a demo drawing many circles (a very edge case).
http://zenozeng.github.io/gsoc2015/p5.js/svg-test/

Though the fps is always about 60,
the circles drawn per second varies when circles increases.
(Tested on my laptop, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHz)
At the very first (before drawing 550 circles), about 40+ circles per second.
However, when 1000 circles already exists in svg, only 20+ circles per second.
When it comes to 20000 circles, only about 1 circle per second.
See also: http://zenozeng.github.io/gsoc2015/p5.js/svg-test/svg.log

The performance is not good, but not so bad.
However, performance can be improved via following ways:

- GC invisible elements
    For instance, remove all nodes when `background()` called.

- provide an API in SVG's manner (already talked above)

    That is, move an existing object rather than draw another new object.
    A OOP API for this, for example.

## Part 2 - PDF support for p5.js

This will based on my current [p5.js-pdf](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-pdf).

As for PDF, I think allow exporting to PDF is enough.

And the future plan is:

- PDF.prototype.beginRecord

- PDF.prototype.endRecord

- Allow using ratio of canvas as PDF ratio

- Allow frames overlay each other

- Vector Support (for Canvas)

    Using canvas to SVG.

- Vector Support (for SVG)

    Maybe using svgToPdf.js and jsPDF.

## Part 3 - About me

I am a junior student of Biosystems Engineering, Zhejiang University.
And I have 3 years of web development experience (both frontend and backend).

Also, I have some experience with SVG, D3 and processing.
I am very active on [github](https://github.com/zenozeng) and would like to contribute to p5.js and extends its possibility for today's web. I really love the goal of p5.js, that is, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for todayâ€™s web.
